Welcome to a sporadic blog about tech, life, education, and whatever else I want to write about.

# Purpose & Background

People have suggested I start documenting my exploits and technical ~~cludges~~ feats for several years. I don't like the idea of sitting down to write - whether it's technical documentation, journaling thoughts, or even class notes - so I put off detailing the fun and exciting things in writing which leads to details being forgotten and stories being lost. 

There have been a few adventures my friends and I have done this year that I actually want people to know about. Let us, dear reader, embark on an adventure and journey of our own: experiencing William's writing and hopeful improvement.

# Expectations

This blog is labeled as "sporadic" for a reason, please don't expect a regular posting schedule. I do, however, want to be diligent in writing about new adventures within a few months of them.

## Use of AI

I use AI fairly often to learn, research, and write. I do not want to use AI to write my posts. If AI content is included in my posts I will notate the usage near the end of the post.
